# Contributing

If you want to start fresh, We have a [todo list](https://filbert-js.vercel.app/docs/todo). 

## Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

* Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make
* Problems show where this project is lacking
* With a question you show where contributors can improve the user experience

Thank you for creating them.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.


### Is it of good quality

* There are no spelling mistakes
* It reads well
* For english language contributions: Has a good score on [Grammarly](grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
